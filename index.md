> `FACE`: There is a [midway](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51935/51935-h/51935-h.htm#PREFACE ) condition which a man of such a destiny will not be able to recall without emotion: it is characterized by a pale, subtle happiness of light and sunshine, a feeling of bird-like `freedom`, bird-like `altitude`, bird-like `exuberance`, and a third thing in which curiosity is united with a tender `contempt`. A free-spirit, this cool expression, does one good in every condition, it’s almost warming. One lives no longer in the fetters of love and hatred, without yes, without no, near or far as one wishes, **preferably slipping away, evading, flattering off, gone again, again flying aloft; one is spoilt**, as everyone is who has at sometime seen a tremendous number of things `beneath` him — and one becomes the opposite of those who concern themselves with things that have nothing to do with them. Indeed, the free-spirit hence forth has only to do with things — and how many things! — with which he is no longer concerned... *[Human, All-Too-Human I.

- On returning from flight I passed Nyangoma, who was climbing a flight of stares in the opposite direction
- This time the flight included both forward motion and backward
- I definately had slept on my tummy
- Day before I'd just created a [catalog](https://abikesa.github.io/catalog/) with 572 entires
- `~/.ssh/id_blocdenotas` was my 572nd entry: this is my first-ever jupyter journal, retired a year ago
- Second-last entry, 571, was [shell](https://abikesa.github.io/shell/) with entries 1-19: the `.sh` scripts for `ghp-import -n -p -t _build/html`
- And third-last entry, 570, was [jb create](https://abikesa.github.io/create/intro.html) that had inspired `.sh` item `#2`: `work/abikesa_jbb_https.sh`
- Had spawned a revolution, including renaming the most frequently used `.sh` item `#3`: `work/abikesa_jbb_sh.sh` (previously `work/abikesa_jbb.sh`)
- Woke up from flying dream with this on my mind: "find GPT-4o instructions on how to change VSCode username" - this will become `.sh` item `#20`
- Meanwhile, `abikesa/flying` will become `abikesa/catalog` entry 572
- Find dreams 1 - 5, perhaps in `blocdenotas`

 Something genetic from Buwala that imposes a POV of freedom, altitude, contempt, and exuberance -- tremendous number of things under "memberships" are `beneath` me
